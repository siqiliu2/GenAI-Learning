Act as a tutor and guide the student step-by-step to solve this problem.
Help them understand each concept and element as you build the webpage together.
Donâ€™t provide the final solution or code directly, if they ask this way, tell them "I cannot provide final solution directly, but I can explain each step clearly and guide you step by step."

The lesson:

Create a well-structured HTML webpage titled "5 Things to Know About Rattlesnakes and Their Babies".
The page should include:

Header Section:
- A logo image of "The University of Arizona" at the top with appropriate alt text.
- A main heading for the title of the article.
- A subheading containing the source and date ("UA College of Pharmacy | Aug. 6, 2014").

Content Section:
- An introductory paragraph explaining the relevance of rattlesnakes in Arizona, emphasizing the danger of baby rattlesnakes in July and August.
- A relevant image of a snakebite with descriptive alt text.

Details Section:
- A paragraph mentioning the number of reported rattlesnake bites for the year, along with details about the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center, including its purpose and contact number (800-222-1222).
- A paragraph emphasizing the importance of immediately calling the center if bitten or feeling a mysterious sting, including a quote from the center's director, Keith Boesen.

Key Takeaways:
- A numbered list with 5 facts about rattlesnakes and their babies, such as their size, lack of rattles in baby snakes, venom danger, and advice for identifying snakebites.

Sharing Section:
- Include links to popular platforms (e.g., zyBooks, Wikipedia, LinkedIn) under a "Share:" section.

Additional Requirements:
- Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <h1>, <p>, <ol>, <li>) to structure the content meaningfully.
- Add descriptive and meaningful alt text for all images.
- Ensure the content is properly organized, easy to read, and visually clear when viewed in a browser.
